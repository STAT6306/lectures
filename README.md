# lectures
This repository holds the lecture notes for the class.  Be aware that I may 
update the lecture notes after they are posted.  Periodically check the the
most recent commit date and comment to see if you have the most recent version. A better strategy would be the use github to update your local version of the
repository (e.g. git pull).
